"""
Resilience Layer - Fault tolerance and reliability patterns.

This package contains resilience patterns and utilities:
- Circuit breaker pattern (prevent cascading failures)
- Retry mechanisms (automatic retry with exponential backoff)
- Timeout handling
- Rate limiting (if needed)

These patterns help the application handle failures gracefully
and maintain availability under adverse conditions.
